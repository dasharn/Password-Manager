# Password Manager
This is a simple password manager built with Python and Tkinter. It allows you to securely store and retrieve passwords for different services. The passwords are encrypted using the Fernet symmetric encryption method from the cryptography library.

## Features
- Generate a secure key for encryption and decryption
- Encrypt and decrypt passwords
- Check the security of a password
- Add and retrieve passwords for different services
- GUI for easy interaction
## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the `main.py` file:

## Code Overview
The code is divided into two main classes: PasswordManager and PasswordManagerGUI.

- PasswordManager is responsible for the core functionality of the password manager. It generates a key for encryption and decryption, encrypts and decrypts passwords, checks the security of a password, and adds and retrieves passwords.

- PasswordManagerGUI is responsible for the user interface of the password manager. It creates a GUI with entry fields for the service, username, and password, and buttons for adding and retrieving passwords.

## Future Improvements
Here are some potential improvements that could be made to the cryptography element of the project:

- Key Storage: Currently, the key is generated when the program starts and is stored in memory. If the program is closed, the key is lost, and the encrypted passwords can no longer be decrypted. A more secure method would be to derive the key from a password entered by the user using a key derivation function like PBKDF2, scrypt, or Argon2.

- Password Storage: The passwords are currently stored in a dictionary in memory. If the program is closed, the passwords are lost. A more secure method would be to use a database that encrypts the data at rest, like SQLite with SQLCipher.

- Password Handling: The passwords are currently handled as strings. This is not secure because strings are immutable and cannot be zeroed out, so the passwords remain in memory until they are garbage collected, and can potentially be read by other processes. A more secure method would be to handle the passwords as byte arrays, which are mutable and can be zeroed out immediately after use.

- Salt: Adding a unique salt to each password before encrypting it will ensure that the encrypted passwords are unique, even if the original passwords are the same.

- Secure Random Number Generator: If you need to generate random numbers elsewhere in your code, make sure to use a secure random number generator.

- Cryptography Best Practices: Cryptography is a rapidly evolving field, and what is considered secure today may not be considered secure tomorrow. Make sure to keep up to date with the latest cryptography best practices and update your code as necessary.
